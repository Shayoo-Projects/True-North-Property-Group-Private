        "Tony and Brandon did an incredible job as our realtors. They worked with us for over a year as we constructed a new home. Since we lived out of the area it was difficult for us to visit the site. Tony and Brandon served as our representatives in nearly every phase of the project and updated us with text, calls, and videos. They even recorded meetings so that we could go back and review the information. I was so impressed with their assistance that I recommended them to my daughter. She is currently using them to facilitate the sale of her home and the purchase of a new home. If you're looking for a realtor team, you should definitely reach out to them. 5 stars!!",

        "Thanks again Tony Smith! It's crazy how an international move ended up being one of the most stress free relocations that we have had in over 20 years of globetrotting. The care and attention you put into ensuring we got into the best home for us was priceless. Even more impressive was the attention that you paid to us AFTER the ink was dry. You had no more obligations but you treated us as if we were your own family. We'll never forget all that you, Brandon and Tonja (and the Lyles family) did to help streamline our home buying process and dim our anxiety. You will forever be an important player for Team Reese!",

        'Brandon is amazing. I purchased an investment property under appraised value through Brandon, an extraordinary feat in this market. As an investor, I am picky/ disciplined with the purchase, so have strict limit on how much I am willing to pay. Brandon was patient with me even though several bids fell short. Brandon also did all the virtual walkthrus for me, as I am not based in DC area, pointing out details both positive and negative about the different properties. Highly appreciate all the local expertise in the search/ walkthru process.',
